Welome to my React Portfolio!

Currently rebuilding my HTML/CSS-based portfolio originally created during my classes at Eleven Fifty Academy.
Here you can browse some of my previous work, find links to my repositories, and learn a little about me.
Please feel free to drop me an email message in the contact section, I am currently open for work!

There is more to come, with updates soon to be listed in full moving forward.

Most recent updates:
5/3: Remove old badge display, add carousel
next: refine carousel, add text and links
