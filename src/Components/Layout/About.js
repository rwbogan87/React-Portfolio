          Currently working as a learning assistant, teaching others the incredible worlds of JS and React.
          Teaching and problem solving have been core skills in my former career as a supply chain professional.  I love the collective mission of finding the right solutions to resolve the issue at hand, and finding the best ones usually require a creative, collaborative approach, and that's where my passion and motivation lie.
